An Elixir Prometheus metrics collection library built on top of Telemetry

---

## Installation

This library is still under active development with changing APIs and forked dependencies...use at your own risk :).

[Available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/prom_ex), the package can be installed
by adding `prom_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:prom_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/prom_ex](https://hexdocs.pm/prom_ex).
